"""
Write a program to find the sum of the elements in the array. 
Input Format: 
Input consists of n+1 integers where n corresponds to the number of elements in the array.
The first integer corresponds to n and the next n integers correspond to the elements in the array.
Assume that the maximum number of elements in the array is 20. 
Output Format: 
Output consists of a double value which corresponds to the mean of the array.
Refer sample input and output for formatting specifications.
